# First Steps in Quant Algorithmic Trading

## Project Overview
This repository marks the beginning of my journey into Quant&Fintech Trading. Before diving deep into advanced Python studies, I created this project with Gemini to implement and test my very first trading algorithms. 
(it seems quite interesting and also made me think if I could do this by myself)
This serves as a foundational record of my transition into the world of algorithmic finance.

Let's just start.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.9.13
